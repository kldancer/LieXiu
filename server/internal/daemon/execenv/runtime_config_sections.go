// This file holds the runtime brief assembler — the post-MUL-3560 path
// that `buildMetaSkillContent` delegates to. It used to be one of two
// paths gated by the `runtime_brief_slim` feature flag against a legacy
// verbose brief; the flag was retired in MUL-4297 and this is now the
// only brief.
//
// Layout:
//
//   - buildMetaSkillContentSlim is the entry point.
//   - It calls classifyTask (runtime_config_kind.go) to pick one of two
//     task kinds, then composes the brief from the per-section writers
//     below.
//   - Each section is its own writer so the matrix of "which kind gets
//     which section" lives at a single dispatch site.
//
// The brief applies two orthogonal optimisations:
//
//  1. Section gating per task kind — quick-create
//     skip sections they have no use for (Mentions, Comment Formatting,
//     Issue Metadata, Sub-issue, ...).
//  2. Per-section prose compression — Available Commands, Issue
//     Body Formatting, Metadata, Mentions, Sub-issue Creation,
//     Comment Formatting, Always Use CLI, Background Task Safety, Task Initiator,
//     Repositories, Output are all tightened. Test-asserted phrases either
//     survive verbatim or are renegotiated to new semantic anchors in the
//     same PR (MUL-5442 established that discipline); no assertion is
//     dropped without a replacement.
//
// Background Task Safety is emitted by `writeBackgroundTaskSafetySlim`
// below.

// writeHeader emits the brief's leading title and one-line elevator pitch.

// writeBackgroundTaskSafetySlim emits the Background Task Safety section
// in its judgment form (MUL-5442): three paragraphs — the platform fact
// everything else derives from (turn exit is task-terminal, no wakeup
// exists, never background-and-yield), the external-systems/CI boundary
// with its single explicit-ask exception, and the persistent-service
// handoff contract. The pinned anchors the tests assert are the fact,
// each boundary, both exceptions, and the handoff triple.
//
// MUL-5223: the external-work boundary alone did not stop agents from
// blocking on CI. Two holes are closed here. First, the boundary was
// stated as a concept while the section's only concrete "how to wait"
// example was a blocking foreground call — and `gh pr checks --watch` is
// exactly that shape, so watching CI read as compliant. Named tool-shape
// bans replace the inference. Second, the "unless acceptance criteria
// require it" escape was being satisfied by the repo's own merge
// requirements ("CI must pass before merge"), so the section now says
// branch protection is not the agent's acceptance criterion, and gives
// the replacement hand-off phrasing so the urge to prove quality lands
// on local test output plus a PR link instead of on a wait.
//
// The ban is scoped, not absolute: an explicitly requested CI result is
// still reachable, and it names the one executable way to collect it
// (a single foreground blocking watch inside the same turn). Enabling
// auto-merge is not a wait and stays allowed — only waiting for it to
// land is banned.
//
// MUL-5274 adds one narrow lifetime exception: a user-requested local
// development/test service may be handed off after its readiness and cleanup
// contract are complete. It is not a future result or wakeup. The brief keeps
// this separate from tests, builds, monitors, and CI polling, which remain
// run-owned until their result is collected. The brief states only the
// handoff contract (lifecycle independence, durable logs, cleanup handle);
// how to detach is the Local Dev Environment skill's concern, not the brief's.
//
// Paragraph order: the CI exception lives INSIDE the boundary paragraph
// (one "The one exception" occurrence, count-guarded in the tests), and the
// persistent-service paragraph closes the section. A former scoping sentence
// ("The rules above apply only to work owned by the current run") stays
// dropped: the boundary paragraph carries its own scope ("are not
// run-owned").
//
// MUL-5442 stage 2 (owner-authorized judgment rewrite): enforcement details
// a frontier model derives from the platform fact were deliberately dropped
// — the run-owned work enumeration, the tool-promise enumeration, the
// wait/collect split rule, the persistent-service scope bullet, the
// auto-merge and snapshot elaborations. Their pins were retired in the same
// change. The incident history above (MUL-5223, MUL-5274, MUL-4091) remains
// the WHY for what stays: the named --watch/watch/poll ban and merge-gate
// denial survive because MUL-5223 proved the principle alone did not stop
// CI-watching, and the handoff paragraph is review-locked verbatim
// (URL/logs/stop triple, general cleanup handle) — do not reword it without
// a fresh review decision.
